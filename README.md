# CafeCocoBistroManagementSystem
<h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>
Café CocoBistro Management System provides help to the café to optimize and control their cafés menu and sales more accurately and efficiently.
This project is a digital management system using Data Structures that helps to keep a record of customer purchases, all the items sales and purchases, the order history, total income, the number of customers per day, and the billing features related to customers.
<h3><b>Working:</b></h3>
Firstly, we have the start menu of our Café CocoBistro management system which has two features or views i.e., Order [Customer] and Admin. In the Order view, the customer can see the menu to purchase the item(s) and in the end, gets their total calculated bill digitally generated. In the Admin view, once the admin logs in, we have different administrative operations such as adding, updating, removing items or prices, and maintaining the customer's record report (BillRecord.exe) as well as viewing their total earning per day. Only the admin can make changes or view data of the management system.
